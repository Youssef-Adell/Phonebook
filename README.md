# Phonebook


## Optimizations 
To improve query performance, **I optimized the database by adding GIN indexes with the gin_trgm_ops operator, resulting in a 94% reduction in query execution cost.** This optimization significantly enhances the efficiency of text-based searches by leveraging trigram indexing.


> [!NOTE]
> I measered the cost after seeding the database with 1 million row.
